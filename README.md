# Passmanpy
Passmanpy is a Python-based password manager designed to securely store and manage your credentials. It uses RSA encryption and creates your vault locally which means you are left to manage your private and public keys. I would recommend encrypting your private key. However, in future implementations Passmanpy will be able to encrypt your private key programmatically.
